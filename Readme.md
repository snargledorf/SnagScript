SnagScript
=========
SnagScript is a JavaScript interpreter library written in C#
* * *
SnagScript started as a project to port the Java based ZemScript interpreter by Cameron Zemek to C#.

Once the port was completed I decided to try and adapt the interpreter to run JavaScript code.

I have included an example interpreter console, and a sample script which trys to display most of the abilities of the interpreter.

Currently the SnagScript supports:

* Some basic syntax 
    * try/catch/finally
    * if/then/else
    * while loop
    * for loop
* Functions
    * Declared and Expression
    * Anonymous and Named
    * Return statements
* Constructors / Classes
* Datatypes
    * Strings
    * Integers
    * Floats
    * Booleans
    * Arrays (Partial)

    SnagScript is based off the Java based script interpreter 'zemscript' written by Cameron Zemek. https://code.google.com/p/zemscript/
